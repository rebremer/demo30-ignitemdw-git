# Extended repo of Microsoft Ignite Data track "demo30: Transforming and enriching data"
Original Ignite repo is extended with 1) Azure DevOps pipeline with DEV/TST/PRD, 2) Managed Identities to authenticate and 3) self-hosted integration runtime to connect to on-prem SQL rather than public website. Git repo can be linked to ADFv2 to load the pipeline and to setup CI/CD in Azure DevOps.See below for more information:
